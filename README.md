# Pond Planner: pond siting and water-harvest estimation

Given a piece of land, this system suggests where a farm pond should go, outlines
the land that drains into it (the **catchment**), and estimates how much water it
can collect in a year.

Two ways to use it:

| Mode | Input | Terrain comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **Draw an area** | A polygon drawn on the map (anywhere in the world) | Downloaded automatically (free elevation tiles) |
| **Upload KML/KMZ** | A contour-map file | Rebuilt from the contour lines in the file |

Live demo: `http://10.1.75.51:3305/`  (API docs: `/docs`)

## How it works

```
polygon or KML/KMZ
      |
      v
 elevation grid (DEM)          AWS Terrain Tiles  or  interpolated contour lines
      |
      v
 fill sinks -> D8 flow direction -> flow accumulation
      |
      v
 rank pond sites (gentle slope + high water supply + basin shape, not a channel)
      |
      v
 catchment of each site = all cells whose flow ends at the site
      |
      v
 water per year = runoff coefficient x annual rainfall x catchment area
```

* **Elevation (draw mode):** AWS Terrain Tiles (Terrarium PNG), a free, keyless, global
  dataset of about 30 m resolution. Tiles are stitched, converted to a local UTM metre
  grid (20 m cells) and cached on disk.
* **Contour mode:** contour lines are sampled and interpolated into the same kind of grid.
* **Hydrology:** depressions are filled, each cell drains to its steepest downhill
  neighbour (D8), and flow is accumulated to find where water gathers.
* **Site ranking:** cells are scored on runoff supply, low slope, local basin shape and
  relief; strong drainage channels are rejected. Candidates are spaced apart.
* **Rainfall:** looked up automatically (NASA POWER 20-year climatology, or Open-Meteo
  ERA5 as a fallback, cached per 0.25 degree cell). It can be overridden.
* **Contours (draw mode):** contour lines shown on the map are generated from the same
  grid, at an automatically chosen interval.

### Assumptions (also shown in the app)

| Assumption | Why |
|---|---|
| Runoff coefficient 0.25 (flat) to 0.55 (steep), estimated from catchment slope | No soil or land-cover data available; can be overridden |
| Pond surface = 3% of its catchment | Common farm-pond rule of thumb; a pond larger than its catchment could fill would sit empty |
| Pond depth 3 m | Holds water through the dry season, limits evaporation, diggable with ordinary machinery |
| Pond volume = half of surface x depth | Pond sides slope inwards, so it holds about half of a straight-sided box |
| Rainfall is a long-term average | A single year can differ a lot |
| Terrain is about 30 m resolution | Bunds, roads, drains and existing ponds are not visible; check sites on the ground |
| "Water per year" is total runoff reaching the site | Evaporation and seepage are not subtracted; the pond can refill several times a year |

## API

Interactive documentation is served at **`/docs`** (Swagger UI).

### `POST /api/analyze-area`: analyse a drawn area

JSON body:

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `polygon` | GeoJSON Polygon/Feature, or list of `[lon, lat]` | required | At most 25 km2 |
| `rainfall_mm` | number | auto | Annual rainfall override |
| `runoff_coefficient` | number 0-1 | auto | Estimated from slope if omitted |
| `max_slope_percent` | number | 8 | Steepest land allowed at a pond site (8 = rises 8 m per 100 m) |
| `minimum_accumulation` | integer | 10 | Minimum upstream cells draining to a site |
| `max_candidates` | integer 1-50 | 10 | Number of pond sites returned |
| `minimum_distance_cells` | integer | 10 | Minimum spacing between sites |

```bash
curl -X POST http://10.1.75.51:3305/api/analyze-area \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"polygon":[[81.281,21.259],[81.291,21.259],[81.291,21.268],[81.281,21.268],[81.281,21.259]]}'
```

### `POST /api/catchment/analyze`: analyse an uploaded contour map

`multipart/form-data`, file field **`contour_map`** (`.kml` or `.kmz`, at most 15 MB).
Optional query parameters: `grid_resolution_m` (default 10), `sample_spacing_m`,
`interpolation_method` (`linear` or `nearest`), `max_slope_percent`,
`minimum_accumulation`, `max_candidates`, `minimum_distance_cells`, `rainfall_mm`,
`runoff_coefficient`. Very large maps are processed on a coarser grid automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST -F contour_map=@contours_1m.kml http://10.1.75.51:3305/api/catchment/analyze
```

### `GET /api/health`

Returns `{"status": "ok", "max_area_km2": 25.0}`.

### Response (both analysis routes)

| Field | Contents |
|---|---|
| `status`, `message` | `"success"` and a readable summary |
| `terrain` | Grid size and resolution, elevation range, CRS, bounds; contour interval (draw mode) or contour validation error (upload mode) |
| `rainfall` | `annual_mm`, `monthly_mm` (12 values), `source`, `measured` (false means a default or manual value), `years` |
| `summary` | (draw mode) `pond_count` and the `best_pond` |
| `timings` | (draw mode) seconds spent in terrain, rainfall wait, hydrology and contours |
| `analysis.candidates[]` | Ranked pond sites (below) |
| `analysis.catchments[]` | `rank`, `area_m2`, `geometry` (GeoJSON), `volume` |
| `map_data` | GeoJSON FeatureCollections: `candidates`, `catchments` (and `contours` in draw mode) |

Each pond in `analysis.candidates[]` (illustrative values):

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "latitude": 20.5263, "longitude": 81.7823,
  "elevation_m": 425.5, "slope_percent": 5.7, "flow_accumulation": 84,
  "score": 0.71,
  "catchment_area_m2": 84400,
  "volume": {
    "annual_runoff_m3": 64490,
    "annual_runoff_litres": 64490000,
    "runoff_coefficient": 0.45,
    "annual_rainfall_mm": 1389,

    "times_filled_per_year": 17.0
  }
}
```

(`catchment_area_hectares` is also present for compatibility with the Phase 2 output.)

### Errors

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | File is not `.kml`/`.kmz` |
| 413 | Upload larger than 15 MB |
| 422 | Invalid polygon, area above the limit, area too small, or unreadable/empty contour file |
| 502 | Elevation tiles could not be downloaded |
| 503 | Server busy: other analyses are queued (retry shortly) |
| 504 | Analysis exceeded the time limit; try a smaller area |

## Limits and behaviour under load

The service is designed to run inside one small host (512 MB RAM, 1 vCPU).

| Safeguard | Value |
|---|---|
| Maximum drawn area | 25 km2 (`POND_MAX_AREA_KM2`) |
| Maximum upload | 15 MB |
| Grid cell budget | 120,000 (draw mode), 250,000 (upload mode); larger inputs are coarsened |
| Concurrency | One analysis at a time; others queue (60 s wait limit, 120 s run limit) |
| Caching | Elevation tiles on disk (`POND_TILE_CACHE`, capped by `POND_TILE_CACHE_MB`, default 300), rainfall per 0.25 degree cell |
| Network resilience | Rainfall sources are queried in parallel; tiles are downloaded concurrently with fast retries |

Measured on the deployment container (1 vCPU, 512 MB):

| Request | Time |
|---|---|
| Draw area, 1 km2, cold (first time) | about 9 s |
| Draw area, 24 km2, cold | about 10 s |
| Draw area, 1 km2, warm (cached) | 0.5 s |
| Draw area, 24 km2, warm | 4.5 s |
| 4 simultaneous 24 km2 requests | all succeed, queued: 4.5, 8.6, 11.8, 16.1 s |
| Upload of a 6.4 MB contour file | about 15-27 s |
| Peak memory (server process) | 175 MB (draw mode), 286 MB (after the contour upload) |

## Running locally

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Node 20+.

```bash
# backend (from the project root)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows;  source .venv/bin/activate on Linux/macOS
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload --port 8000

# frontend (second terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                       # http://localhost:5173, talks to port 8000
```

Tests:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

Configuration (environment variables): `POND_MAX_AREA_KM2`, `POND_TILE_CACHE`,
`POND_TILE_CACHE_MB`. In development the frontend reads `VITE_API_URL` from
`frontend/.env.development`; in a production build it calls the same origin.

## Deployment (single host)

The backend also serves the built frontend, so one process is enough.

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build                       # produces frontend/dist
# copy backend/ and frontend/dist to the host, then on the host:
python3 -m venv venv && venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -r backend/requirements.txt
nohup venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000 --workers 1 > server.log 2>&1 &
```

In the course deployment the container's port 3000 is exposed as 3305.
